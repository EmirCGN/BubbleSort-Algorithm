# BubbleSort and BinarySearch

Welcome to the BubbleSort and BinarySearch project! ðŸš€

This project showcases the implementation of the BubbleSort algorithm and BinarySearch algorithm in C#. It allows you to sort an array of numbers and perform a search for a specific number within the sorted array.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- .NET SDK (version XYZ or above)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bubblesort-binarysearch.git
   ```
   
  
 2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
   cd bubblesort-binarysearch
  ```
  
 3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
  ```
  
 4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
  ```
  
 # Usage
When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter the number of elements in the array. Enter the desired count and press Enter.

Next, you will be prompted to enter the elements of the array. Enter each element one by one and press Enter after each entry.

The program will then display the unsorted array.

The BubbleSort algorithm will be applied to sort the array in ascending order.

The program will display the sorted array.

You will then be prompted to enter a number to search for in the sorted array. Enter the desired number and press Enter.

The BinarySearch algorithm will be performed to find the number in the array.

The program will display whether the number was found in the array and its corresponding index if it was found.
